# Preparation for Capstone Project

## 0. Create your capstone project's repo 
Working on your capstone project, here are a few things that you are expected to do in anticipation to the start of your project.

    Create a GitHub repository called alx_capstone_project
    Inside this repository, create a README.md file
    In the README.md file, write briefly on the following topics:
        Project Overview:
            Provide a brief description of the project, its purpose, and goals. Explain what problem the project aims to solve or what value it brings to users.
        Features and Functionality:
            List the main features and functionalities of the project. Describe how users can interact with the application and any notable aspects or unique selling points.
        Technologies Used:
            Specify the technologies, frameworks, and languages used in the project. This can include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, specific libraries, or frameworks like Flask, and any other tools or services utilized.
        Screenshots or Demo:
            Include screenshots or a link to a live demo if available. Visual representations can help readers understand the project’s appearance and functionality.
        Roadmap and future enhancements:
            Share any future plans or potential improvements for the project. This could include additional features, performance optimizations, or scalability considerations.
        Contact information:
            Include your name, along with contact information or links to personal portfolios or social media profiles.

## 1. Workflow for Your Project 
Design an Easy-to-Understand Workflow:

    Choose a project of your preference.
    Create a workflow to visualize the project’s steps and processes.
    Utilize flowcharts to represent the workflow clearly.
    Recommended resource: Watch this video tutorial on creating flowcharts: Flowchart Tutorial Video.

## 2. Design Your Prototype 
After creating your workflow, proceed to develop the Prototype for your web application:

    You have two options for the prototype (Low or high fidelity prototypes)
    Select either a low or high fidelity prototype.
    For a low fidelity prototype, consider using tools like draw.io.

    For a high fidelity prototype with enhanced aesthetics, use Figma.
